content: "The Manastash Ridge Observatory is in Ellensburg, WA-about 100 miles from UW’s Seattle
campus. Years ago, there were plans for a solar project with battery backup. The project was
even funded by the Campus Sustainability Fund. However, due to the lead engineer stepping
away from the project, it was never completed. The partially completed system is shown in
picture 1 below. In Spring 2019, UW Solar was approached by Oliver Fraser from the
Department of Astronomy. Oliver hoped that UW Solar could take over the project and get it
finished up so that the observatory would be more sustainable and be able to close the dome
hatches to the telescope (shown in picture 2) in case of a power outage. There was one main
problem UW Solar discovered while completing the design of the system: the inverter that was
already purchased for the system had limited output and we didn’t know if it would be able to
power the electric panel for the telescope room. James Clough (shown in picture 3) visited the
observatory in late October and measured the power usage of the telescope room while the
astronomy students did their work in the night. James’ data showed that the inverter could easily
power the telescope room during regular usage! Now, UW Solar will be moving forward with our
design and we hope to have the project completed next year."
