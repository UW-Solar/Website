content: "The Manastash Ridge Observatory is a place for UW Astronomy students to study the sky in real life. UW Solarâ€™s project, the installation of a solar array placed directly on the ground, will primarily aid in providing back-up power to the Manastash Ridge telescope in the case of an outage, as well as producing supplementary power. As of this quarter, a more developed project, preparation for grant applications, and a new finance team are all in development. Funds, cost estimates, and structural assessments are only some of the necessary measures taken to finalize this process."
