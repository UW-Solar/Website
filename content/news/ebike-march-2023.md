A lot of exciting progress has been made for this project! The electrical and structural designs have been completed, funding has been secured, the feasibility study is done, a general RFQ has been written, and a new location has been chosen: the future site of the E-Bike Charging Station will be located near Founder's Hall and Oak Hall. The reasons for this new location were security, to make it more visible to students, and to align with UW Transportation's goals for increasing bike commuter traffic on campus. Here's to hoping to seeing our own e-vehicle charging station on campus at the end of the year! <br>
Below is an image for the new location:
