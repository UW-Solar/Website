The Solar Canopy Project is currently working with UW Transportation and has a lot to look forward to. Currently they are looking into solar panel manufacturers, contacting companies, and battery cell providers. Also they've assigned a project manager had expect that their first design update will be within the month. Additionally, they're currently discussing possible grant options. Best of luck to them moving forward! <br>
