UW Farm volunteers, the Resiliency Tunnel project team would love your input! We’re working on a greenhouse and indoor-outdoor educational space that will enable the UW Farm to grow produce with higher nutritional value in greater quantities and offer dynamic learning opportunities in agriculture and sustainability. <br>
Why we're reaching out: As a student team, we've successfully procured funding from CSF, completed a feasibility study, and are looking to move forward into more detailed design and perhaps even construction this upcoming summer. As UW Farm volunteers, you all are well acquainted with the space we’re working with and we'd love your participation or feedback."
