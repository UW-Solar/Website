## NEWS

This directory contains all news articles found on the **News** page of the UW Solar website.

In order to add a news article, create a markdown (`.md`) file and use the following template:

```
---
title: ""
date: ""
author: ""
content: ""
image: ""
---
```

Below is a table with the breakdown of what each component of the template means:

Component | Meaning
--- | ---
title | The Title of the News Post.
date | The date the News Post was created. **MAKE SURE THERE IS NO 'TH' OR ANY OTHER DATE ABBREVIATION IN THE DATE. DATES SHOULD BE OF THE FORMAT: MONTH (full word, e.g. January, February, etc) DD, YEAR**.
author | The author of the News Post.
content | The text associated with the news article. All text will be displayed as one large paragraph so if you have a longer blog post, try to split it up into several that summarize the news that you'd like to report.
image | **THE IMAGE IS OPTIONAL**. No image required for a news entry, however if you'd like to have an image go along with the news post, place the image into `static/News` and give only the file name here. Example: If you wanted to include a image called "newsarticle.png" with your news post, you would paste this image into the `static/News` folder, and then in the template you'd write `image: "newsarticle.png"`.
