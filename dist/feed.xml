            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Manastash Ridge Observatory is in Ellensburg, WA-about 100 miles from UW’s Seattle campus. Years ago, there were plans for a solar project with battery backup. The project was even funded by the Campus Sustainability Fund. However, due to the lead engineer stepping away from the project, it was never completed. The partially completed system is shown in picture 1 below. In Spring 2019, UW Solar was approached by Oliver Fraser from the Department of Astronomy. Oliver hoped that UW Solar could take over the project and get it finished up so that the observatory would be more sustainable and be able to close the dome hatches to the telescope (shown in picture 2) in case of a power outage. There was one main problem UW Solar discovered while completing the design of the system: the inverter that was already purchased for the system had limited output and we didn’t know if it would be able to power the electric panel for the telescope room. James Clough (shown in picture 3) visited the observatory in late October and measured the power usage of the telescope room while the astronomy students did their work in the night. James’ data showed that the inverter could easily power the telescope room during regular usage! Now, UW Solar will be moving forward with our design and we hope to have the project completed next year.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I’m Jordan Sliz, a MUP student and a member of UW Solar.  I got the opportunity to represent us at the Washington Solar Summit, and I’m excited to tell you what I learned there.  Of course, it was held remotely, so things were different, but the seminars were varied and informative.  I sat in for:<br> • Making the Most of Energy Storage and Other DERs: A Venture-Capital Perspective with Andy Lubershane<br> • Solar & Environmental Justice: Equity in Clean Energy with Mikhaila Gonzales, Oriana Magnera, and Tim Willink, and<br> • Scaling Up: What it Takes to Get to 100% Clean Energy with Frank Afranji and Duane Jonlin<br> The first presentation was about getting the most out of data and resources, to manage the onset of solar.  Key takeaways were that we need to implement storage and good system design to make sure that EV charging ramps up right as solar becomes less effective, i.e. at sunset, our system can handle the load.  For solar systems to be successful, they need to make as much economic benefit as possible, be as hands-off for the user as current products are, and minimize impact on other customers as much as possible.  As solar gets implemented, there will be lopsided benefit to those who can afford it, a problem called load deflection wherein people of means are selling too much electricity back to the grid for the utility to make money and negatively impacting lower-income customers.<br> That last point is a great segway to the next presentation I saw, which was all about equity in solar implementation.  Right off the bat, the presenters shook my understanding by pointing out that access is not equal to equity, when it comes to resources.  A community can have access to solar-derived electricity, without having control or community oversight in its production.  In virtually every instance, lower-income communities bear the burden of living near infrastructure.  If new substations, or massive solar facilities, need to be constructed, it is not wrong to assume they’ll likely be built in “less desirable” neighborhoods.  Of course, the subtext there is that those communities have less fiscal and political power to make sure they see fair benefit.  Decentralizing power infrastructure reduces environmental risk of fire, lowers emissions, and empowers communities with resiliency and control.  They showed a fantastic example of the Spokane Nation’s new solar projects, and the benefits they gained from controlling its construction and maintenance. The GRID Alternative program worked with Spokane Nation to generate 5.5MW for 667 AI/AN people, give job experience training, and save Spokane Nation $2.3 million over 35 years.<br> The final presentation I saw was centered on the realities of power systems, and what a “perfectly clean” power system would require.  They spoke about regional programs to tackle carbon emissions, and how they could be successful. No coal by 2030 means generating more than 1400MW per year until then by solar, wind, water, geothermal, and energy storage.  But there was one part that captured all of my attention.  Strikingly, and maybe in stark contrast to the way we solar-hopefuls think about the future of power, the economic expense to reach true 0-carbon power is up to 6x more expensive than achieving a 90% reduction in carbon output.  It raises real questions about hybrid solutions and the co-benefits of developing carbon capture technologies to make our clean energy future a reality.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[As these last couple of weeks of summer go by, UW Solar wanted to put out a general update for what is to come in Autumn 2020. First, we will be at the 31st Annual RSO Activities Fair to answer questions, promote our club, and look for new members. Don't forget that UW Solar is open to people in all majors and class standings. UW Solar will be working on some very exciting projects this Fall, some of which are almost a decade in the making. The UW Campus Solar Plan and Fleet Electrification Plan are both set to release in December 2020. That means UW Solar is going to be finishing these plans during Fall 2020. If you would like to be a part of creating these plans, reach out to us on any social media platform or email us at solaruw@uw.edu. We are so excited that UW has pledged to follow these plans that push us all towards a more sustainable future. So, tune in to our blog and social media platforms to hear about our progress on these plans. Have a great fall, huskies!]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The University of Washington has been working on their new Sustainability Action Plan for a while now. According to the website, the plan was "built on five Guiding Principles addressing student learning outcomes, research impact, diversity equity & inclusion, responsible use of our resources, and of course, decarbonization of our energy sources. UW Solar advised the university on two parts of the plan Electrifying UW Transportation and implementing the Campus Solar Plan." UW Solar has been working on these two plans for over a year, and we are very excited to see the university make these commitments to operate more sustainably.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This event was the culmination of 4 years of work by UW Solar on the Life Sciences Building project. Alex Ratcliff was at the center of this project for UW Solar, first working with the architects at Perkins+Will to make the roof of the building solar ready, and later changing the design of the south facade such that photovoltaic fins were installed rather than metal blades. The event featured Jan Whittington of UW Solar, Alex Ratcliff of UW Solar and PAE and Evan Leonard of Artisan Electric. The event started with a project summary outlining the cooperation with the contractors to integrate solar in the building. Then it moved on to recognizing all the sponsors of the project: Perkins+Will, VECA, Artisan, STF and CSF. We ended by looking forward at what UW Solar had coming up next.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[UW Solar is excited to announce that construction on the rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system began on Monday October 7th, 2019! This project started all the way back in January 2016 when Perkins+Will agreed to let UW Solar advise them on the construction of PV fins on the side of the Life Sciences Building and the rooftop PV array. Perkins+Will made crucial design decisions based on our advice that allow the solar install to be seemless. The rooftop solar panels will be the final piece of the multi-year collaboration. Artisan Electric was contracted to do the design and construction for the rooftop PV system. Throughout the project, UW Solar students will be allowed to visit the rooftop on select days to see the construction and ask questions. The construction is slated to finish in the first half of November. UW Solar students ask questions to the site foreman the week after all of the materials were lifted onto the rooftop.]]></content:encoded>

The trip was primarily undertaken to learn more about the existing conditions and quantities of the materials there so that we could improve and expand upon our design for our proposed solar array. We took the trip with Oliver Fraser of the UW Astronomy Department and his students. They hope to make use of the existing solar equipment to make the Observatory grid independent and resilient.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Solar arrays on Alder, Elm and Maple Hall were one of our main focus for the past two years, and we were happy to see the project was completed at last March. From now on, UW Solar will start to look at the system performance and the research opportunities from the data stream.
The new Life Sciences Building under construction contains one really fascinating feature related to UW Solar – Building Integrated Photovoltaics for shadowing fins. This year, our group will keep providing support for this cut-edge technology to be applied on UW campus as the pioneer for all educational institutions in the U.S.
Last but not least, we are forming a campus plan for all UW buildings where solar energy might be applicable. UW Solar ‘s ultimate goal has always been making UW more sustainable by integrating renewable energy sources as much as possible!]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[UW Solar came to the Earth Day again this year! We were, as usual, passionately talking about the benefits of solar energy and how we helped UW Campus to enhance the sustainability by installing more solar panels on different buildings.
This year, we witnessed the completion of a 105 kW solar system distributed on Alder, Elm and Maple Hall on west campus, which quadrupled the capacity to provide renewable energy to west campus residents.
One significant recognition our group got this year is the Green Husky Award, which indicates UW Solar’s leadership role in improving campus sustainability.]]></content:encoded>

Artisan Electric, our contractor of the CEI Testbed project, has already finished 99 percent of Maple and the 50 KW system of Alder is under construction. For some of us, it was the first time we could actually see what real solar panels look like and we were super excited to witness our project come to the final stage from blueprint. People from Artisan were really helpful in providing our members detailed information about the solar system and the construction process. Thanks, Artisan!]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[CEI Testbeds. We are excited to cooperate with Housing & Food Services (HFS) again! Two years ago, we successfully installed 34kw solar panels on the roof of Mercer A. This time we are doing three buildings, Alder Hall, Elm Hall and Maple Hall. Residents on west campus, hopefully, will be able to utilize 100kw electricity from solar by May 1st!
Life Sciences Building. A brand new building on Pacific way will start to rise up during this summer for the department of life sciences. What is more facinating is that UW Solar will try to put Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) as shading lanes. We were awarded $7,500 from Campus Sustainability Fund (CSF) for feasibility study. We hope the reasearch we are doing can help administrators to make a decision for getting more solar on campus!
Port of Seattle. The first part of the project focuses on Pier 69 which is the headquarter of Port of Seattle. The feasibility study will be finished before June 1st. As a pilot project, pier 69 will be helpful for both Port of Seattle and UW Solar to explore the possibility of having more solar on other properties owned by Port of Seattle around the Seattle community.]]></content:encoded>
