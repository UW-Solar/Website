Don't forget that UW Solar is open to people in all majors and class standings. UW Solar will be working on some very exciting projects this Fall, some of which are almost a decade in the making. The UW Campus Solar Plan and Fleet Electrification Plan are both set to release in December 2020. That means UW Solar is going to be finishing these plans during Fall 2020. If you would like to be a part of creating these plans, reach out to us on any social media platform or email us at solaruw@uw.edu.

However, due to the lead engineer stepping away from the project, it was never completed. The partially completed system is shown in picture 1 below. In Spring 2019, UW Solar was approached by Oliver Fraser from the Department of Astronomy. Oliver hoped that UW Solar could take over the project and get it finished up so that the observatory would be more sustainable and be able to close the dome hatches to the telescope (shown in picture 2) in case of a power outage. There was one main problem UW Solar discovered while completing the design of the system: the inverter that was already purchased for the system had limited output and we didn’t know if it would be able to power the electric panel for the telescope room. James Clough (shown in picture 3) visited the observatory in late October and measured the power usage of the telescope room while the astronomy students did their work in the night. James’ data showed that the inverter could easily power the telescope room during regular usage!

I got the opportunity to represent us at the Washington Solar Summit, and I’m excited to tell you what I learned there.  Of course, it was held remotely, so things were different, but the seminars were varied and informative.  I sat in for:\u003Cbr\u003E • Making the Most of Energy Storage and Other DERs: A Venture-Capital Perspective with Andy Lubershane\u003Cbr\u003E • Solar & Environmental Justice: Equity in Clean Energy with Mikhaila Gonzales, Oriana Magnera, and Tim Willink, and\u003Cbr\u003E • Scaling Up: What it Takes to Get to 100% Clean Energy with Frank Afranji and Duane Jonlin\u003Cbr\u003E The first presentation was about getting the most out of data and resources, to manage the onset of solar.  Key takeaways were that we need to implement storage and good system design to make sure that EV charging ramps up right as solar becomes less effective, i.e. at sunset, our system can handle the load.  For solar systems to be successful, they need to make as much economic benefit as possible, be as hands-off for the user as current products are, and minimize impact on other customers as much as possible.  As solar gets implemented, there will be lopsided benefit to those who can afford it, a problem called load deflection wherein people of means are selling too much electricity back to the grid for the utility to make money and negatively impacting lower-income customers.\u003Cbr\u003E That last point is a great segway to the next presentation I saw, which was all about equity in solar implementation.  Right off the bat, the presenters shook my understanding by pointing out that access is not equal to equity, when it comes to resources.  A community can have access to solar-derived electricity, without having control or community oversight in its production.  In virtually every instance, lower-income communities bear the burden of living near infrastructure.  If new substations, or massive solar facilities, need to be constructed, it is not wrong to assume they’ll likely be built in “less desirable” neighborhoods.  Of course, the subtext there is that those communities have less fiscal and political power to make sure they see fair benefit.  Decentralizing power infrastructure reduces environmental risk of fire, lowers emissions, and empowers communities with resiliency and control.  They showed a fantastic example of the Spokane Nation’s new solar projects, and the benefits they gained from controlling its construction and maintenance. The GRID Alternative program worked with Spokane Nation to generate 5.5MW for 667 AI\u002FAN people, give job experience training, and save Spokane Nation $2.3 million over 35 years.\u003Cbr\u003E The final presentation I saw was centered on the realities of power systems, and what a “perfectly clean” power system would require.  They spoke about regional programs to tackle carbon emissions, and how they could be successful. No coal by 2030 means generating more than 1400MW per year until then by solar, wind, water, geothermal, and energy storage.  But there was one part that captured all of my attention.  Strikingly, and maybe in stark contrast to the way we solar-hopefuls think about the future of power, the economic expense to reach true 0-carbon power is up to 6x more expensive than achieving a 90% reduction in carbon output.  It raises real questions about hybrid solutions and the co-benefits of developing carbon capture technologies to make our clean energy future a reality.",image:f,toc:[],body:{type:a,children:[]},dir:b,path:"\u002Fnews\u002Fwash-solar-summit-2020",extension:c,createdAt:"2022-12-06T05:59:42.934Z",updatedAt:"2022-12-06T06:53:17.635Z"}]}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("root","\u002Fnews",".md","Yuxuan Chen","Evan Mickelson","","2022-12-06T05:59:42.927Z","2022-12-06T05:59:42.929Z","2022-12-06T05:59:42.931Z","2022-12-06T05:59:42.933Z","2022-12-06T06:53:17.624Z","2022-12-06T05:59:42.926Z","2022-12-06T06:53:17.625Z","2022-12-06T05:59:42.928Z","2022-12-06T06:53:17.627Z","2022-12-06T06:53:17.629Z","2022-12-06T05:59:42.932Z","2022-12-06T06:53:17.631Z","2022-12-06T06:53:17.633Z")));
