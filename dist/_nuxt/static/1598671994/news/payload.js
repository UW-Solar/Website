Perkins+Will made crucial design decisions based on our advice that allow the solar install to be seemless. The rooftop solar panels will be the final piece of the multi-year collaboration. Artisan Electric was contracted to do the design and construction for the rooftop PV system. Throughout the project, UW Solar students will be allowed to visit the rooftop on select days to see the construction and ask questions. The construction is slated to finish in the first half of November.
